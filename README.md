#Far Flight

Fly as far as you can without crashing. You can play it [here](http://edwrodrig.github.io/farflight/).

##Description
**Far Flight** is a simple serverless *javascript* game that simulates 3d using *canvas* 2d context primitives. It's the final stage of several graphical demos originally programmed in *C++* using *Allegro* and then ported to *javascript*. Some of this demos are published in the following links:
* [Polyshape](http://edwrodrig.github.io/polyshape)
* [Isometric Rotation](http://codepen.io/edwrodrig/pen/ynfJo)
* [Fast Flight - Game Edition](http://codepen.io/edwrodrig/pen/KgbAt)
